!! !!Analysis symbols
! ----------------
!! The morphological analyses of wordforms for the Lushootseed
!! language are presented in this system in terms of the following symbols.
!! (It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

!! The parts-of-speech are:
 +N +A +Adv +V                                 !!≈
 +Pron +CS +CC +Adp +Po +Pr +Interj +Pcle +Num !!≈

!! The parts of speech are further split up into:
 +Prop +Pers +Dem +Interr +Refl +Recipr +Rel +Indef

!! The Usage extents are marked using following tags:
 +Err/Orth
 +Use/-Spell

!! The nominals are inflected in the following Case and Number
 +Sg +Du +Pl
 +Ess +Nom +Gen +Acc +Ill +Loc +Com +Com/Sh

!! The possessor indices are marked as such:
 +PxSg1 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ first person singular
 +PxSg2 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ second person singular
 +PxSP3 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ third person singular or plural
 +PxPl1 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ first person plural
 +PxPl2 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ third person plural

!! The comparative forms are:
 +Comp +Superl
!! Numerals are classified under:
 +Attr +Card
 +Ord
!! Verb moods are:
 +Ind +Prs +Prt +Pot +Cond +Imprt
!! Verb personal forms are:
 +Sg1 +Sg2 +Sg3 +Du1 +Du2 +Du3 +Pl1 +Pl2 +Pl3
!! !!Direct Object conjugation
 +OcSg1 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * object conjugation first person singular
 +OcSg2 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * object conjugation second person singular
 +OcSP3 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * object conjugation third person singular or plural
 +OcPl1 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * object conjugation first person plural
 +OcPl2 !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * object conjugation second person plural

!! Other verb forms are
 +Inf +Ger +ConNeg +ConNegII +Neg +ImprtII +PrsPrc +PrfPrc +Sup +VGen +VAbess

! Abbreviated words are classified with:
 +ABBR +ACR
!! Special symbols are classified with:
+CLB +PUNCT +LEFT +RIGHT
!! The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:
 +TV +IV
!! Special multiword units are analysed with:
 +Multi
!! Non-dictionary words can be recognised with:
 +Guess

!! Question and Focus particles:
 +Qst +Foc

!! Gender
+Msc
+Fem

!! Semantics are classified with
 +Sem/Mal +Sem/Fem +Sem/Sur
 +Sem/Plc
 +Sem/Org
 +Sem/Obj
 +Sem/Ani
 +Sem/Hum
 +Sem/Plant
 +Sem/Group
 +Sem/Time
 +Sem/Txt
 +Sem/Route
 +Sem/Measr
 +Sem/Wthr
 +Sem/Build
 +Sem/Edu
 +Sem/Veh
 +Sem/Clth


!! Derivations are classified under the morphophonetic form of the suffix, the
!! source and target part-of-speech.
 +V→N +V→V +V→A
 +Der/xxx
 +Der/Dim !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * diminutive
 +Der/s !!≈ * _@CODE@_ * Noun derivation

!! Morphophonology
! ---------------
!! To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
!! symbols in the lexicon files:
 {aä} {oö} {uü}

!! And following triggers to control variation
 {front} {back}
%^Red1CV1toCV2C !!= * @CODE@ 2-segment to 3-segments with vowel change
%^Red1CV1toCV2CPL !!= * @CODE@ 2-segment to 3-segments with vowel change Plural
%^Red2CVC2CVCCVC !!= * @CODE@ 3-segment reduplication

!! !!Flag diacritics
!! We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
!! flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
!! with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 @P.NeedNoun.ON@    !!≈ | @CODE@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 @D.NeedNoun.ON@    !!≈ | @CODE@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 @C.NeedNoun@       !!≈ | @CODE@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
!! 
!! For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
!! to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
!! handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
!! do no harm.
 @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 @D.CmpPref.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 @D.CmpLast.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Block such words from entering R
 @D.CmpNone.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.
!! 
!! Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
!! nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
!! these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
!! given the proper use of these flags.
 @U.Cap.Obl@        !!≈ | @CODE@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 @U.Cap.Opt@        !!≈ | @CODE@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.

LEXICON Root
!! The word forms in UNDEFINED language start from the lexeme roots of basic
!! word classes, or optionally from prefixes:
!   Nouns   ; This is fed entirely by Prefixes
   Verbs   ;
   Adjectives  ;
   Pronouns    ;
   Numerals    ;
   Prefixes    ;
