!!Analysis symbols
----------------
The morphological analyses of wordforms of UNDEFINED language are presented
in this system in terms of following symbols.
(It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

The parts-of-speech are:

The parts of speech are further split up into:

The Usage extents are marked using following tags:

The nominals are inflected in the following Case and Number

The possessor indices are marked as such:
 * _+PxSg1_ first person singular
 * _+PxSg2_ second person singular
 * _+PxSP3_ third person singular or plural
 * _+PxPl1_ first person plural
 * _+PxPl2_ third person plural

The comparative forms are:
Numerals are classified under:

 *  +Der/Dim  diminutive

Morphophonology
---------------
To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
symbols in the lexicon files:

And following triggers to control variation
 * %^Red1CV1toCV2C  2-segment to 3-segments with vowel change
 * %^Red1CV1toCV2CPL  2-segment to 3-segments with vowel change Plural
 * %^Red2CVC2CVCCVC  3-segment reduplication


We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics:




!VERBS



The word forms in UNDEFINED language start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes, or optionally from prefixes:

 * __#; __ Clitic
